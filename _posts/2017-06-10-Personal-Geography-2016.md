For the past few years I have recorded my movement using [OpenPaths](https://openpaths.cc/) on my iPhone and at the end of each year produced [simple maps](https://flic.kr/s/aHsjDQ3qje) using a [script](https://gist.github.com/thomascorrie/9378502/) I wrote in [Processing](https://processing.org/) and some [Ordnance Survey data](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/opendata-products.html/).

During 2015 the OpenPaths website suffered from some access issues and the app was prone to crashing and hadn't been updated since April 2012 (and still hasn't). At the same time I had joined [Vitality](https://www.vitality.co.uk/) and one the ways of accumulating points towards their rewards and premium reductions was to track steps using [Moves](https://www.moves-app.com/) which I tried out and liked. It captures data more regularly than OpenPaths and attempts (fairly accurately) to work out what method of transportation you are using, albeit at the cost of battery usage. Since Moves (like OpenPaths) also offers the ability to export your data in a wide range of formats I decided to start using that as my primary method of location tracking. I should note that while OpenPaths was set up explicitly to able uses to be in full control of their data and what happens to it, Moves can use the information it collects from its users [very broadly](https://www.moves-app.com/privacy/).
